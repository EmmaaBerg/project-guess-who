# Project Name

Project for week 5 was to create a Guess-who game using Javascript. 

## The problem
This is the second project with Javascript and I still find it hard to understand. But from last week I feel that I understand the fundamental parts about JS better on its own, but I struggle when I try to combine them. To approach this project I followed the steps on the Notion page and googled a lot. If I had more time I would try to add more, or maybe change, information about the characters and by so practice to use Javascript even more.
