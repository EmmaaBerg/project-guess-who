# Project Name

Project for week 5 was to create a Guess-who game using Javascript. 

## The problem
This was the second week with JS and for this project we got a lot of starter code. The purpose was to figure out and understand how to connect the blocks of code and why it's connected that way. 

If I had more time I would try to add more, or maybe change, information about the characters and by so practice to use Javascript even more.
